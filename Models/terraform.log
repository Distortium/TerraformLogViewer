Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.12.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v5.12.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Warning: The provider hashicorp/aws v5.12.0 has known issues with certain regions; consider upgrading to a newer version for better stability.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

Planning phase starting...
- Reading configuration from main.tf...
- Refreshing state... (this may take a moment)

Dependencies (added for clarity):
  - aws_security_group.example_sg depends on aws_vpc.example_vpc (explicit via depends_on; implicit via vpc_id)
  - aws_instance.example depends on aws_vpc.example_vpc (implicit via subnet_id and vpc_security_group_ids)
  - aws_instance.example depends on aws_security_group.example_sg (implicit via vpc_security_group_ids; explicit via depends_on)

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.example will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      + ami                         = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1d0"
      + instance_type               = "t2.micro"
      + tags                        = {
          + "Name" = "ExampleInstance"
        }
      + vpc_security_group_ids      = (known after apply)
      + subnet_id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # aws_security_group.example_sg will be created
  + resource "aws_security_group" "example_sg" {
      + description = "Example security group"
      + name        = "example-sg"
      + vpc_id      = (known after apply)
    }

  # aws_vpc.example_vpc will be created
  + resource "aws_vpc" "example_vpc" {
      + cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
      + tags       = {
          + "Name" = "ExampleVPC"
        }
    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
